									<h1>Open Positions</h1>

									<p>Graduate student and post-doctoral position are available in the statistical and computational genomics research group of Dr. Noah Zaitlen, a faculty member at the University of California Los Angeles. The fellow will work closely with Dr. Zaitlen, other quantitative Ph.D’s in his group, and collaborators at UCLA, UCSF, Harvard, and Mount Sinai. They will be free to pursue their own statistical and computational research interests and potentially be provided with funding for functional genomic experiments including cell-free DNA, single-cell RNA, and whole-genome sequencing of  patient samples and tumors from the UCLA health care system. We are broadly interested in application of advanced statistical and computational methods to medical and population genetics as well as molecular technology development. Questions that we aim to answer include: (1) What are the biologically and clinically distinct subtypes of heterogeneous complex traits  (2) How are genetic processes coordinated across cell types in health and disease states, and (3) Which association scoring statistics/prediction methods provide maximum power/AUC to identify associations/determine future outcomes in longitudinal cohorts with combined electronic medical record and genomic data?

									Qualifications:

									Exceedingly strong quantitative research background; practical experience working with large real-world genetic data sets, developing new methods, and a track record producing high-quality published work. Preference will be given to candidates with degrees in computer science, statistics, or other applied quantitative fields.

									Additional Information:

									Please submit a brief statement of interest, CV, contact information for at least 3 references, and two sample publications by email to Noah Zaitlen, nzaitlen@ucla.edu.</p>
